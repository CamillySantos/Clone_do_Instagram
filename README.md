# Clone_do_Instagram
Clone do Instagram em React

Nesse exercício vamos construir uma aplicação clone do Instagram utilizando React. 
É necessário que tudo pareça com a página principal do Instagram, então temos que ter posts, comentários, botões para curtir e comentar. Não é necessário que nada funcione, mas se quiser, pode.

Para que o projeto não fique genérico ou simples demais, vamos dar um foco maior na escolha do conteúdo: imagine que todo o feed do instagram é feito por pessoas que você admira (pessoas que não existem) e o post de cada uma delas é aquilo que esta pessoa mais quer ver. Escolha algumas pessoas e vamos ver o que sai disso.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
